# Security Analysis Dashboard

This document provides an overview of all security analysis tools configured for the TurboCat.CatCar project.

## üîí Security Analysis Tools

### 1. CodeQL Analysis
- **Purpose**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for C# code
- **Scope**: Identifies security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and potential bugs
- **Reports**: Available in GitHub Security tab ‚Üí Code scanning alerts
- **Frequency**: Runs on every push and pull request
- **Query Suites**: 
  - Security Extended (comprehensive security analysis)
  - Security and Quality (combined security and code quality)

### 2. Trivy Vulnerability Scanner
- **Purpose**: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and infrastructure scanning
- **Scope**: Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and configuration files
- **Reports**: Available in GitHub Security tab ‚Üí Code scanning alerts
- **Frequency**: Runs on every push and pull request
- **Severity Levels**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM

### 3. SonarQube/SonarCloud Analysis
- **Purpose**: Code quality, maintainability, and security analysis
- **Scope**: Technical debt, code smells, duplications, coverage, and security hotspots
- **Reports**: Available at SonarCloud Dashboard
- **Frequency**: Runs on every push and pull request
- **Quality Gate**: Must pass for successful CI/CD pipeline

## üìä Accessing Security Reports

### GitHub Security Tab
1. Navigate to your repository
2. Click on the "Security" tab
3. Select "Code scanning alerts" to view:
   - CodeQL security findings
   - Trivy vulnerability reports

### SonarCloud Dashboard
1. Visit [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io)
2. Navigate to your project dashboard
3. Review:
   - Security Hotspots
   - Code Coverage
   - Quality Gate status
   - Technical Debt

### Codecov Dashboard
1. Visit [Codecov](https://codecov.io)
2. Navigate to your repository
3. Review:
   - Test coverage reports
   - Coverage trends
   - Uncovered lines

## üö® Security Alert Response

### High/Critical Severity
1. **Immediate Action**: Address within 24 hours
2. **Assessment**: Determine exploitability and impact
3. **Remediation**: Apply patches or implement workarounds
4. **Verification**: Re-run security scans to confirm fixes

### Medium Severity
1. **Planned Action**: Address within sprint cycle
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate business impact
3. **Prioritization**: Include in backlog planning

### Low/Info Severity
1. **Monitoring**: Track trends and patterns
2. **Technical Debt**: Address during refactoring cycles

## üîß Configuration Files

- **CodeQL Config**: `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- **SonarQube Properties**: Configured in CI/CD pipeline

## üìà Metrics and KPIs

Track these security metrics over time:
- Number of security vulnerabilities by severity
- Time to remediation for security issues
- Code coverage percentage
- SonarQube Quality Gate pass rate
- False positive rate for security alerts

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### CodeQL Issues
- Check build logs for compilation errors
- Verify .NET SDK version compatibility
- Review excluded paths in configuration

### Trivy Issues
- Update Trivy database: `trivy image --clear-cache`
- Check for false positives in vulnerability database
- Review scan scope and file types

### SonarQube Issues
- Verify authentication tokens
- Check project key configuration
- Review quality gate rules
